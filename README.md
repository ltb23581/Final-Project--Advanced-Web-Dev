For my NMIX 4020 (Advanced Web Development) final project, I created an interactive world where a player can explore, walk around, and interact with NPCs to know more about me. 
This project serves a starting point for my interactive resume and the path of CS I want to continue progressing on. 
In the future, I hope to create more works similar to this style and expand on the functionalities seen in this project.
